It works by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the predicted values from the line. These differences are called residuals. By squaring and summing them, the method ensures that large errors are penalized more, resulting in a line that best represents the overall trend in the data. This leads to accurate and reliable predictions and provides statistically optimal estimates under standard regression assumptions.\n",
